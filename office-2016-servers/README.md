### Connect

The Virtual Machines do not have public IPs assigned, as a result you can not RDP to the machines. Deploy an additional VM with a public IP as a "Jumpbox" for troubleshooting or create
a site to site VPN to access via the internal network. Publishing is done via Windows Application Proxy.

### Content

.\Templates
This folder contains all the individual product templates

.\Artifacts
This folder contains requires DSC and Setup files

.\PrepareOnly.ps1
This will create a storage account and uploads all artifacts. This is typically used when you plan to deploy the templates manually one by one using Portal, PS or CLI

.\PrepareAndDeploy.ps1
This will create a storage account, uploads all artifacts and starts an automated deployment end to end. In this scenario make sure you adjust the azuredeploy.parameters.json file in each template subdirectory.
