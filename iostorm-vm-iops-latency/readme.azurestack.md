## VM IOSTORM WORKLOAD FOR AZURESTACK (LOCAL) ##


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>

This template deploys requested number of VMs and a controller VM with public IP address in same virtual network. Controller VM synchronizes IO workload on all VMs, collects and analyse results and upload it to the storage account.

Please make sure to user unique resource group name for each deployment to avoid deployment failures due to name collisions of resources.

NOTE: There is a 90 minutes Azure time-out which you can hit if large number of VMs are deployed. To circumvent that, all these operations are done using Scheduled Task which gets created by a DSC Script Resource by a Controller VM.
