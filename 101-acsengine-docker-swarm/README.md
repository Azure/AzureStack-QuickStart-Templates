The Azure Container Service Engine (acs-engine) generates ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates for Docker enabled clusters on Microsoft Azure with your choice of DC/OS, Kubernetes, Swarm Mode, or Swarm orchestrators. This template is generated using ACS Engine and will install a Docker Swarm cluster. The template was modified with simple changes to fit the needs of AzureStack.
