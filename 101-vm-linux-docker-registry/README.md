# Docker Registry on Azure Stack

This template deploys an unsecure (no TLS encryption) docker registry that uses an existing Azure Stack storage account to persist your container images.

This template is just for illustrative purposes only and it is **not** recommended for production environments.

## Prerequisites

1. Ubuntu Server 16.04 is syndicated from Azure Stack's Marketplace
2. Custom Script Extensions for Linux 2.0  is syndicated from Azure Stack's Marketplace
3. A storage account where persist container images

## Usage

### HTTP Registries

You have to explicitly allow your docker client access to unsecure registries before you can use interact with it.

That can be done by adding a new entry to `insecure-registries` in your `daemon.json` configuration file. More information [here](https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/#deploy-a-plain-http-registry).

### Populate your Registry

Your registry can store images you produce yourself or images from any public registry. The only requirement is to apply the appropriate [tag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/#tag-an-image-for-a-private-repository) to the images.

```bash
# fetch an image from docker hub
docker pull hello-world:latest
# re-tag it using your registry information
# my-registry => Public IP DNS Label
docker tag hello-world:latest my-registry:80/hello-world:latest
# push to your private registry
docker push my-registry:80/hello-world:latest
```

## Future improvements

- Run multiple containers
- Support/document self signed certs
- Support/document CA issued cert
